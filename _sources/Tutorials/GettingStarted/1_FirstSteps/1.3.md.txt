# 1.3 - Configuring your System

Now that you've installed GNUstep, you need to configure it. You should have installed `SystemPreferences.app`. Go ahead and open it up. If you installed GNUstep from your distribution, you might have an app called "SystemPreferences" in your app list. If not, you can type in the terminal:

```bash
openapp SystemPreferences
```

SystemPreferences looks like this:

## Changing the theme

By default, GNUstep looks pretty ugly (at least to people who are used to flat design or the glassy Aqua style). However, there're many themes available for GNUstep. To see them, please look at the [Theme Gallery](/Reference/Configuration/ThemeGallery.md).
