# Core Graphics / Quartz 2D

Core Graphics uses the Core Foundation object model.

Official description:

> The Core Graphics framework is based on the Quartz advanced drawing engine. It provides low-level, lightweight 2D rendering with unmatched output fidelity. You use this framework to handle path-based drawing, transformations, color management, offscreen rendering, patterns, gradients and shadings, image data management, image creation, and image masking, as well as PDF document creation, display, and parsing.
> 
> In macOS, Core Graphics also includes services for working with display hardware, low-level user input events, and the windowing system.
