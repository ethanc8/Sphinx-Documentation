# Human Interface Guidelines

GNUstep supports many themes and configuration settings that you should adhere to. On Windows, you might want to make your app conform to the Windows HIG. Many GNUstep apps adhere to the Mac HIG or the OpenStep HIG.

## OpenStep style

The default theme, along with the Heritage theme, is designed to look like the NeXT user interface. When designing apps for GNUstep+WindowMaker, this HIG should be used.

The HIG for GNUstep+WindowMaker uses the OpenStep HIG by default, except for icon design.

## Mac OS X HIG

Most Cocoa apps somewhat follow one version of this HIG.
