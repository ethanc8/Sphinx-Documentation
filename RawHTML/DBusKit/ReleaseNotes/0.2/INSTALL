1 Installation Instructions
***************************

1.1 Required software
=====================

As an Objective-C framework, DBusKit depends on recent versions of the
GNUstep Makefile Package and the GNUstep Base Library.  Versions 2.4.0
and 1.20.0 (respectively) are known to work.  D-Bus support is provided
by libdbus.  DBusKit has been verified to work with version 1.2.1 of
libdbus, but might work with earlier versions.  Some advanced features
(e.g.  generating D-Bus interfaces from Objective-C headers) require
libclang.  Usage of libclang can be disabled by passing the
"-disable-libclang switch" to the configure script.  To build the
testsuite, the UnitKit framework is required.  It is available from the
Étoilé repository (https://github.com/etoile/UnitKit/).

   Please note that UnitKit requires the GNUstep Objective-C runtime
(https://github.com/gnustep/libobjc2) and the clang compiler.  Clang is
also required to build the included user notification bundle.  The
global menu bundle can only be built if gnustep-gui is available.

   * gnustep-make (>=2.4.0)

   * gnustep-base (>=1.22.0)

   * libdbus (>=1.2.1)

   * gnustep-gui (required only for global menu bundle)

   * clang (required only for user notification bundle)

   * libclang (optional)

   * UnitKit (optional)

1.2 Build and Install
=====================

To build and install DBusKit type 'make install'.  This will
automatically configure the framework prior to building and installing.
DBusKit will usually tell your compiler to treat warnings as errors, if
you don't want that behaviour, add the 'nonstrict=yes' flag to your
'make'-invocation.
