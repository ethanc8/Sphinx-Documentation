            <h2><a name="001001000000">
          Enterprise Control Configuration and Logging
        </a></h2>
    <p>

          Classes and tools for building and administering 24*7
          server processes for large scale software systems.
            </p>

            <h2><a name="001002000000">The Control command line tool</a></h2>
    <p>

          Based around the
          <a rel="gsdoc" href="EcControl.html#class$EcControl">EcControl</a>

            class, this server process provides a central
            command/control point and acts as the SNMP
            agent for integration of a cluster of Objective-C
            based processes.
              </p>
    <p>

            On startup, (or configuration change) the configuration
            dictionary from Control.plist (plus any included
            files) is written to /tmp/Control.cnf to provide a
            record of the latest config.
              </p>
    <p>

            Periodically, the file /tmp/Control.alive is
            updated to indicate that the process is still
            running correctly. If the user default string
            ControlVersion is defined, it is written to
            one line of this file and in any case a timestamp is
            written.
              </p>
    <p>

            If the EcControlKey NSUserDefault (32 hex digits) is set
            when the Control server is started, it must also be
            set to the same value in Control.plist, and on startup
            the Control server then requires manual entry of a key
            from the terminal (and makes the string entered
            (leading and trailing white space stripped)
            available as EcControlKey in the configuration
            information it gives to other processes. <br />
            This for instance allows all processes in a cluster to
            use a single encryption key never stored on disk.
            <br /> The value of EcControlKey in Control.plist
            must be the MD5 hash of the value entered as the
            master key, otherwise the Control server will log a
            warning and shut down. <br /> For purposes of
            automated testing only, Control.plist may contain
            the master key (64 hex digits) in EcControlKeyTest. In
            this case EcControlKey need not be defined as an
            NSUserDefault (because the Control server
            does not need to read the master key from the
            terminal).
              </p>

              <h2><a name="001003000000">The Command command line tool</a></h2>
    <p>

            Based around the
            <a rel="gsdoc" href="EcCommand.html#class$EcCommand">EcCommand</a>

              class, this server process provides the
              configuration/logging/launch
              facilities for all processes on a single
              machine. It obtains centralised configuration
              from the Control server and sends logging, alerts
              and alarms to that server.
                </p>

                <h2><a name="001004000000">The Console command line tool</a></h2>
    <p>

              Based around the
              <a rel="gsdoc" href="EcConsole.html#class$EcConsole">EcConsole</a>

                class, this process provides an interactive
                command-line based interface for
                controlling the entire system via the
                Control server. <br /> It may also be used in a
                non-interactive mode to send commands
                to any process and wait for responses. In
                non-interactive mode the tool uses the
                following additional
                command-line-arguments/user-default-keys
                and/or environment variables:
                  </p>
<br /> Pass (or the
              ConsolePass environment variable) specifies
              the password for the user login to the Control
              server. <br /> Line (or the ConsoleLine
              environment variable) specifies the command
              line to be used (as if type in interactively). If
              the command line is sent, the process exit status is
              0, but if a failure occurs the status is 1 (except as
              noted below). <br /> Wait (or the ConsoleWait
              environment variable) specifies the number of
              seconds to wait for the result of the command. If
              this timeout occurs, the process exit status is 2.
              <br /> Want (or the ConsoleWant environment
              variable) specifies the regular expression to
              match a single line success response to the
              command. <br /> Fail (or the ConsoleFail
              environment variable) specifies the regular
              expression to match a single line failure
              response to the command. If this response is
              matched, the process exit status is 3. <br />
              Quiet (or the ConsoleQuiet environment variable) is
              a boolean which, if true, will suppress any output
              while waiting for a response. <br /> If the Control
              server cannot be contacted, the process exit
              status is 10. <br /> If the Control server
              actively refuses the login, the exit status is
              11.
            
                  <h2><a name="001005000000">
                The AlarmTool command line tool
              </a></h2>
    <p>

                The AlarmTool command line tool provides a
                mechanism to raise and clear alarms (using
                the ECCL alarm system) from a process which is not
                itsself ECCL enabled (ie not built using the
                ECCL classes). <br /> You may use this to generate
                logging from shell scripts or from Java
                servlets etc.
                  </p>
    <p>

                The tool requires at least four (usually six)
                arguments: <br /> &apos;-Cause NN&apos; the probable
                cause of the alarm (type of problem). <br />
                &apos;-Component NN&apos; the component which raised
                the alarm. <br /> &apos;-Problem NN&apos; the specific
                problem which raised the alarm. <br />
                &apos;-Process NN&apos; the name of the process which
                raised the alarm. <br /> &apos;-Repair NN&apos; a proposed
                repair action to fix the issue. <br />
                &apos;-Severity NN&apos; the severity of the problem
                (defaults to &apos;cleared&apos;, in which case the
                Repair action is not required). <br />
                  </p>

                  <h2><a name="001006000000">
                The LogTool command line tool
              </a></h2>
    <p>

                The LogTool command line tool provides a mechanism
                to log various types of messages (using the ECCL
                logging system) from a process which is not
                itsself ECCL enabled (ie not built using the
                ECCL classes). You may use this to generate
                logging from shell scripts or from Java
                servlets etc.
                  </p>
    <p>

                The tool requires at least two arguments: <br />
                &apos;-Name XXX&apos; specifies the name under which the
                message is to be logged and <br /> &apos;-Mesg XXX&apos;
                specifies the content of the message to be
                logged. <br /> The optional &apos;-Mode XXX&apos;
                argument specifies the type of log to be
                generated (one of Audit, Debug, Warn, Error
                or Alert) and defaults to generating a &apos;Warn&apos; log.
                  </p>

                  <h2><a name="001007000000">
                The Terminate command line tool
              </a></h2>
    <p>

                The Terminate command line tool provides a
                mechanism to shut down an ECCL host. This
                tool contacts a Command server and tells it to
                shut down all it&apos;s local client process and then
                shut itsself down. <br /> Each client of the
                Command server is given thirty seconds to shut
                down gracefully, and if it has not shut down when
                this period is over, the Command server is free to
                kill it. <br /> You can expect Command servers to
                have shut down within forty seconds of the
                Terminate command being run.
                  </p>
    <p>

                You may use &apos;-CommandHost&apos; and &apos;-CommandName&apos; to
                specify a Command server to contact, otherwise
                the default local Command server is contacted (or
                if there is no local server, any available Command
                server on the local network is contacted).
                  </p>
    <p>

                If you wish to terminate everything in a cluster,
                you may use the &apos;-CommandName&apos; argument to specify
                the name of the &apos;Control&apos; server of the cluster
                rather than the &apos;Command&apos; server of an
                individual host. In this case the tool will
                contact the Control server, and the Control
                server will in turn send a terminate message to
                each Command server in the cluster, before closing
                down itsself.
                  </p>
