QuartzCore currently does not work with AppKit very well. There is a currently unsolved bug in Opal preventing this. For more information, see the [2018 Google Summer of Code project](https://gist.github.com/sbrki/efe8b94444946bde1bd3fa241071c8b2) that aimed to make QuartzCore work with AppKit better.

QuartzCore is **highly incomplete**!
