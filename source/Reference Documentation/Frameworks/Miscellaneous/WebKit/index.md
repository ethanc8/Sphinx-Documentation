# WebKit

WebKit is a web rendering engine.

## Incomplete WebKit port - GSoC 2017

Please see the [information about this port](https://gist.github.com/theiostream/7b9e83997320ccade6b5ec749cdc3573).

This is a port of the Mac version of WebKit to GNUstep. It's currently very hard to install, and only supports JavaScriptCore. The incompatibility is partly due to the use of private APIs and partly due to APIs not implemented in Opal.

## Embed WebKitGtk using XEmbed

This was created for the NeXTSPACE project, so it might not compile.
