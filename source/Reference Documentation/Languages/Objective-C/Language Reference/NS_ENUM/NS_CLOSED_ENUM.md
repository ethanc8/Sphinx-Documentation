# `NS_CLOSED_ENUM` / `CF_CLOSED_ENUM`
Declares a frozen enum.

## Declaration
```objc
#define NS_CLOSED_ENUM(_type, _name) CF_CLOSED_ENUM(_type, _name
#define CF_CLOSED_ENUM(_type, _name) /* ... */
```
## Parameters

> type name **`_type`**  
> The integer type used for the values of the enum.

> identifier **`_name`**  
> The name of the generated typedef.

## Discussion

Use the `NS_CLOSED_ENUM` or `CF_CLOSED_ENUM` macro for a simple group of constants that you can never add new cases to. Closed enumerations are useful for representing a finite set of states that you expect people to switch over using a switch statement. Once an enum is marked as closed, it is a binary and source incompatible change to add a new value.

The three cases of `NSComparisonResult`—`NSOrderedAscending`, `NSOrderedSame`, and `NSOrderedDescending`—are an example of a finite set. They're the only logical cases for performing an ordered comparison during tasks like sorting.

Don't use the `NS_CLOSED_ENUM` or `CF_CLOSED_ENUM` macro if:

* You've ever added cases to an enumeration after its initial declaration

* You can think of additional cases you might add later

* The enumeration has any private cases

In these scenarios, use the `NS_ENUM` or `CF_ENUM` macro instead.

## Importing into Swift

* Swift >= 5

When used in a `switch` statement whose last case is `@unknown default:`, the Swift compiler will emit a warning if not all cases of a frozen enum have not been specified. For example:

```objc
typedef NS_CLOSED_ENUM(NSInteger, GregorianMonth) {
  GregorianMonthJanuary = 1,
  GregorianMonthFebruary,
  GregorianMonthMarch,
  GregorianMonthApril,
  GregorianMonthMay,
  GregorianMonthJune,
  GregorianMonthJuly,
  GregorianMonthAugust,
  GregorianMonthSeptember,
  GregorianMonthOctober,
  GregorianMonthNovember,
  GregorianMonthDecember
}
```

Can be switched on. For example:

```swift
var month: GregorianMonth = /* ... */
switch month {
    case .january: break
    @unknown default: break
}
```

will cause a compiler warning because not all cases of the closed enum have been specified.
