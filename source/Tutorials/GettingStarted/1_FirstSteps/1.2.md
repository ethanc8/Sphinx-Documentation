# 1.2 - Installing GNUstep

Before you install GNUstep, you must choose if you want to install the old or new Objective-C runtime. The old runtime is easier to install on some systems, but harder to install on other systems. The new runtime allows you to use newer Objective-C features. The new runtime requires LLVM, so any system that does not support LLVM cannot use the new runtime.

You might want to use an online installation, so that you don't have to mess with your system and can access it from any computer with an internet connection.

Please choose your operating system below.

```{note}
Whenever the words "type into the terminal" or similar appear, please open a terminal emulator (it might be named "Terminal", "Console", or "Command Prompt"), type in the line below, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on your keyboard.
```

## Debian-based (Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu, elementary, Mint)

### Old runtime

To install the GNUstep libraries and development tools:
```bash
sudo apt install gnustep-devel gnustep-core-doc systempreferences.app gworkspace.app
```
(Optional) To install the GNUstep apps:
```bash
sudo apt install gnustep gnustep-examples gnustep-games
```

### New runtime

Both of these methods will install the **development version** of GNUstep.

#### Using `gnustep-build` scripts

Select a script from [`github.com/plaurent/gnustep-build`](https://github.com/plaurent/gnustep-build). For example, on Raspbian 11 Bullseye:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Projects/GNUstep/Install
cd ~/Projects/GNUstep/Install
sudo apt install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libcurl4 # Required for NSURLSession, which is required for networking
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plaurent/gnustep-build/master/raspbian-11-clang-11.0-runtime-2.1-ARM/GNUstep-buildon-raspbian11.sh
nano --view GNUstep-buildon-raspbian11.sh
bash GNUstep-buildon-raspbian11.sh
```

#### Using `tools-startup` scripts

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Projects/GNUstep/Install
cd ~/Projects/GNUstep/Install
git clone https://github.com/gnustep/tools-startup
cd tools-startup
sudo ./InstallGNUstep
```

## Fedora

### New runtime

#### Using `tools-startup` scripts

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Projects/GNUstep/Install
cd ~/Projects/GNUstep/Install
git clone https://github.com/gnustep/tools-startup
cd tools-startup
sudo ./InstallGNUstep
```

## EL (RHEL, CentOS, Oracle, Rocky, Alma)

## Arch / Manjaro

## SuSE

## FreeBSD

## Microsoft Windows

## Android

It's not currently possible to install the GNUstep developer tools on Android, but you can build Android apps using the [GNUstep Android Toolchain](https://github.com/gnustep/tools-android).
