# Miscellaneous

* [ ] Create Sphinx-compatible API references
    * Sphinx extension to enable linking to RawHTML folder easily
        * We'll just use Intersphinx and create the `object.inv` ourselves
    * Sphinx extension to automatically turn symbols into links to RawHTML folder
    * "proper" way:
        * Script to parse `igsdoc` into RST
        * Sphinx extension to add an API reference "domain"
* [ ] Split into subprojects -- e.g. each library gets its own project with API reference and the pages here, each tutorial is its own project. We could use the ADC theme for the subproject-generated PDFs. This would let us build PDFs for each tutorial separately.
* [ ] Build PDFs for API references
* [ ] Build PDFs for tutorials
* [ ] Publish to GitHub
