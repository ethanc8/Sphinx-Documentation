# API Documentation Roadmap

The current API documentation is convoluted, disorganized, and aesthetically unpleasing.

In my opinion, we should create an API documentation page looking similar to the ones generated by [`pgi-docgen`](https://github.com/pygobject/pgi-docgen) -- see the documentation for [`Gtk.Button`](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/Button.html#Gtk.Button). This is one of the most usable interfaces I've seen.

However, currently we have multiple options to create better API documentation.

* Improve Autogsdoc
* Use Etoile Documentation Generator (`etdocgen`)
    * [Github repository](https://github.com/etoile/DocGenerator)
    * [Example - EtoileFoundation](http://etoileos.com/dev/api/EtoileFoundation/README.html)
    * This one colorizes the APIs and organizes by topic.
    * However, it needs some tweaks -- which might be possible in CSS -- to increase the font size and overall appearance
    * Not actively developed
* Use `appledoc`
    * [Archived website](https://web.archive.org/web/20131120063634if_/http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc)
    * [Example](https://web.archive.org/web/20140402163707if_/http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/AFNetworking/1.3.1/Classes/AFHTTPClient.html)
    * [Github repository](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc)
    * Might not compile on GNUstep.
* Otis
    * [Github repository](https://github.com/brynbellomy/otis)
    * [Javascript example](http://brynbellomy.github.io/otis/lib/otis.js.html)
    * Supports Objective-C, but I have no idea how that looks.
* Doxygen
    * Not the most intuitive output by default, but extremely customizable.
    * We could use Breathe or Exhale to convert to Sphinx, but right now they don't have good support for Objective-C, because Sphinx doesn't have good support.
* Use HeaderDoc
* Use XSDocGen based on HeaderDoc
    * [Github repository](https://github.com/macmade/XSDocgen)
    * [Example](https://doc.xs-labs.com/ClangKit/)
* Projects without much info
    * [ASDoc based on HeaderDoc](https://github.com/darricktheprogrammer/ASDoc)
    * [HeaderDoc to Markdown](https://github.com/MetamediaTechnology/objective-c-markdown-document-generator)
    *
