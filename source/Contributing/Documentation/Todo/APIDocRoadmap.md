# API Documentation Roadmap

One goal is to eventually create an API documentation page looking similar to the ones generated by [`pgi-docgen`](https://github.com/pygobject/pgi-docgen) -- see the documentation for [`Gtk.Button`](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/Button.html#Gtk.Button). This is one of the most usable interfaces I've seen.
