# Language Versions

> **Note**: Versions before Stepstone 4.0 are missing.

> **Note**: In order to solve the confusing versioning scheme of Objective-C, this document uses its own versioning scheme which is similar to the current, extremely vague scheme.

    * Not supported anywhere anymore
    * Different from GNUstep garbage collection
* Properties `@property`
    * Automatic getter and setter generation `@synthesize`
    * Dot notation `object.count` instead of `[object count]` and `[object setCount: ]`
* Non-fragile ivars (requires runtime support)
* Fast enumeration `for (id thing in myList)`
* properties (via the @property, @synthesize and @dynamic keywords), fast enumeration (not available in Objective-C++), attributes for methods (such as deprecated, noreturn, sentinel, format), the unused attribute for method arguments, the @package keyword for instance variables and the @optional and @required keywords in protocols
