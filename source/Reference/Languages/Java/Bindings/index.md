# Bindings - JIGS

JIGS (Java Interface for GNUstep) allows you to use GNUstep from Java. It's currently very underdeveloped -- the GUI bindings are experimental, but Base is supposedly working well.

It might not support the modern GNUstep Objective-C runtime. It's mostly been tested on 2000s i386 Linux.
