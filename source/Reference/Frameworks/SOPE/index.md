# SOPE

Version 5.5.5

SOPE is a group of frameworks, including a WebObjects implementation and much more. It's used as the base of SOGo (Scalable OpenGroupware.org) and OpenGroupware.org. It uses a fork of GDL1 as its EOF implementation, which is very limited. However, it supports almost all of WebObjects 4.5 (the last Objective-C WebObjects version outside of Apple).
