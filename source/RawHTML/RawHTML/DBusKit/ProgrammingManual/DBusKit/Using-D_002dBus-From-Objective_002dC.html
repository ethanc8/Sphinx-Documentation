<span id="Using-D_002dBus-From-Objective_002dC-1"></span><h2 class="chapter">2 Using D-Bus From Objective-C</h2>
<p>In order to access D-Bus services from an Objective-C application, the
DBusKit framework is required. It provides infrastructure for
managing connections to D-Bus message buses and translating Objective-C
message sends to D-Bus method calls. This way, DBusKit can make
interacting with D-Bus objects appear quite similar to the way one
usually interacts with the DO system.
</p>
<span id="Generating-Protocol-Declarations-With-dk_005fmake_005fprotocol"></span><h3 class="section">2.1 Generating Protocol Declarations With dk_make_protocol</h3>

<p>If your application wants to invoke methods on D-Bus objects, some
preparations are required: As with all other code, you need to provide
declarations for the methods you want to invoke. You can either do this
by writing them manually or let the <b>dk_make_protocol</b> tool
generate them for you. This is possible if an .interface-file containing
the introspection data for the interface exists. Calling <b>dk_make_protocol</b> with the &ldquo;<b>-i</b>&rdquo;
switch and the name of the .interface-file will generate a header file
with an Objective-C protocol declaration for that interface. For the
hypothetical interface file for <em>org.freedesktop.Introspectable</em>,
<b>dk_make_protocol</b> might generate the following header file:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
/*
 * Objective-C protocol declaration for the D-Bus
 * org.freedesktop.Introspectable interface.
 */
@protocol org_freedesktop_Introspectable

- (NSString*)Introspect;

@end
</pre></div>
<p>The generated header file does only contain method declarations with
arguments and return values that are Objective-C classes. The following
default mappings between Foundation classes and D-Bus types are defined:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td width="15%">NSNumber</td><td width="80%">booleans (b), integers (y, n, q, i, u, x, t), floating point values (d)</td></tr>
<tr><td width="15%">NSString</td><td width="80%">strings (s)</td></tr>
<tr><td width="15%">DKProxy</td><td width="80%">object paths (o)</td></tr>
<tr><td width="15%">NSFileHandle</td><td width="80%">file descriptors (h)<a id="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a></td></tr>
<tr><td width="15%">NSArray</td><td width="80%">arrays (a?), structs ((?*))</td></tr>
<tr><td width="15%">NSDictionary</td><td width="80%">dictionaries (a{??})</td></tr>
<tr><td width="15%">id</td><td width="80%">variants (v)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Here &ldquo;?&rdquo; denotes a single complete D-Bus type signature and &ldquo;*&rdquo;
denotes possible repetition. It is, however, possible to use the plain C
types corresponding to the D-Bus types, because DBusKit is capable of
determining all necessary conversions. Thus the following declarations
all specify valid ways to invoke <code>NameHasOwner()</code> method from
<em>org.freedesktop.DBus</em>:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">- (NSNumber*)NameHasOwner: (NSString*)name;
- (NSNumber*)NameHasOwner: (char*)name;
- (BOOL)NameHasOwner: (NSString*)name;
- (BOOL)NameHasOwner: (char*)name;
</pre></div>

<p>By default, <b>dk_make_protocol</b> generates protocol declarations that
are compliant with Objective-C 2. It will thus produce
<code>@property</code>-style declarations for properties of D-Bus objects.
This behaviour can be disabled by passing the &ldquo;<b>-1</b>&rdquo; switch to the
programme.
</p>
<span id="Obtaining-a-Proxy-to-a-D_002dBus-Object"></span><h3 class="section">2.2 Obtaining a Proxy to a D-Bus Object</h3>
<p>With these provisions in place, it is quite easy to obtain a proxy to a
D-Bus object. The process is quite similar to creating a proxy to a
distant object using DO. First, you create the required ports:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">DKPort *sPort = [[DKPort alloc] initWithRemote: @&quot;org.freedesktop.DBus&quot;
                                         onBus: DKDBusSessionBus]
DKPort *rPort = [DKPort sessionBusPort];
</pre></div>
<p>If a service on the system bus was the desired target, one could pass
<code>DKBusSystemBus</code> as the second argument of the <code>DKPort</code>
initialiser or use the <code>+systemBusPort</code> convenience method to
create a port object without remote.
</p> 
<p>Afterwards, a connection can be obtained to the
<em>org.freedesktop.DBus</em> service (which is bus itself) as follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">NSConnection *c = [NSConnection connectionWithReceivePort: rPort
                                                 sendPort: sPort];
</pre></div>
<p>Please note that this is exactly the way one would create a Distributed
Objects connection. Consequentially, on can obtain a proxy to an object
of this service by using <code>-rootProxy</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">id remoteObject = [c rootProxy];
</pre></div>
<p>Unfortunately, a proxy to the root object of a D-Bus service is very
often not useful because services tend to install their primary object
at a path corresponding to the service name. DBusKit thus
extends <code>NSConnection</code> with a <code>-proxyAtPath:</code> method, which
can be used to obtain proxies to non-root object. It could be used to
obtain a proper proxy to <em>org.freedesktop.DBus</em> like this:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">id remoteObject = [c proxyAtPath: @&quot;/org/freedesktop/DBus&quot;];
</pre></div>

<span id="Sending-Messages-to-D_002dBus-Objects"></span><h3 class="section">2.3 Sending Messages to D-Bus Objects</h3>
<p>All further interactions with the remote object are indistinguishable
from interactions with an object in the local process. E.g. the
introspection data of the remote object could be obtained like this:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">NSString *introspectionData = [remoteObject Introspect];
</pre></div>

<span id="Overloaded-methods"></span><h4 class="subsection">2.3.1 Overloaded methods</h4>
<span id="index-interface_002c-D_002dBus-1"></span>
<span id="index-method_002c-D_002dBus"></span>
<span id="index-D_002dBus-interface-1"></span>
<span id="index-D_002dBus-method"></span>
<p>In some cases it is, however, necessary to treat D-Bus objects special:
Since D-Bus allows method names to be overloaded per interface, it might
be necessary to specify which method to call. DBusKit provides two
facilities to cope with this kind of situation. For one, it is possible
to embed the information about the required interface in the selector
string of the method to call. This is done by replacing all dots in the
interface string with underscores, placing it between <code>_DKIf_</code>
<code>_DKIfEnd_</code> marker and appending the method name.
</p>
<p>Assuming a D-Bus object  implements a <code>getBass()</code> method in the
interfaces <code>org.foo.Fish</code> and <code>org.bar.Instruments</code>, one could
distinguish between the methods by constructing the following selectors:
</p><ul>
<li> <code>-_DKIf_org_foo_Fish_DKIfEnd_getBass</code>
</li><li> <code>-_DKIf_org_bar_Instruments_DKIfEnd_getBass</code>
</li></ul>
<p>Since this is obviously quite clumsy, it will only be feasible for
simple cases. 
</p>
<p>The other facility provided by DBusKit is the
<code>-setPrimaryDBusInterface:</code> method, which instructs the proxy to
prefer the named interface when looking up methods. E.g. the following
statements would result in a call to the correct method:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">[remoteObject setPrimaryDBusInterface: @&quot;org.bar.Instruments&quot;];
id anInstrument = [remoteObject getBass];
</pre></div>

<span id="D_002dBus-_2018out_2019-Arguments"></span><h4 class="subsection">2.3.2 D-Bus ‘out’ Arguments</h4>
<p>Some D-Bus methods include multiple ‘out’ arguments (return values):
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;method name=&quot;GetServerInformation&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;name&quot; type=&quot;s&quot; direction=&quot;out&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;vendor&quot; type=&quot;s&quot; direction=&quot;out&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;version&quot; type=&quot;s&quot; direction=&quot;out&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/method&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>For methods of this type, DBuskit will combine all values returned by the
remote D-Bus object into a single <code>NSArray</code> return value. So the 
Objective-C method signature of the method mentioned above would be
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">- (NSArray*) GetServerInformation; 
</pre></div>

<span id="Accessing-and-changing-D_002dBus-properties"></span><h3 class="section">2.4 Accessing and changing D-Bus properties</h3>
<span id="index-property_002c-D_002dBus"></span>
<span id="index-D_002dBus-property"></span>
<p>DBusKit will automatically generate getters and setters for D-Bus properties. A
D-Bus interface might, for example, specify the following property in its
introspection data:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;property name=&quot;address&quot; type=&quot;s&quot; access=&quot;readwrite&quot;/&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>This property can then be accessed by calling <code>-address</code> and changed by
calling <code>-setAddress:</code> on the proxy object. Just like with other methods,
both the plain C types and the corresponding Foundation classes are valid as
parameters to the getter and setter methods:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">- (NSString*)address;
- (char*)address;
- (void)setAddress: (NSString*)address;
- (void)setAddress: (char*)address;
</pre></div>
<p>If other methods with the same names exist within the same interface of the
remote object, those will take precedence over the generated getter and setter
methods.
</p>
<span id="Watching-D_002dBus-Signals"></span><h3 class="section">2.5 Watching D-Bus Signals</h3>
<span id="index-signal_002c-D_002dBus"></span>
<span id="index-D_002dBus-signal"></span>
<p>Besides responding to method calls, D-Bus objects can also actively
inform remote objects about events or state changes by the use of
<em>signals</em>. These signals are published to the bus and the bus will
re-broadcast them to all connected entities that subscribe to the
signals. DBusKit includes support for receiving D-Bus signals through
the <code>DKNotificationCenter</code> class. <code>DKNotificationCenter</code> keeps
to OpenStep conventions in that it delivers the signals it receives from
D-Bus in the form of <code>NSNotification</code>s and is thus similar to the
notification center classes provided by the Foundation library
(gnustep-base).
</p>
<p>To make use of the notification feature, it is sometimes not even
necessary to create any explicit proxies. It is enough to just obtain a
reference to one of the notification centers:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">DKNotificationCenter *center = [DKNotificationCenter sessionBusCenter];
</pre></div>
<p>(Again, a reference to the notification center for the system bus can be
obtained similarly by using <code>+systemBusCenter</code>.) In a very simple
case, one would simply use the center to add an object as an observer of
the <em>NameAcquired</em> signal from the <em>org.freedesktop.DBus</em>
interface.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">[center addObserver: myObject
           selector: @selector(didReceiveNotification:)
               name: @&quot;DKSignal_org.freedesktop.DBus_NameAquired&quot;
             object: nil];
</pre></div>
<p>This example also illustrates the naming convention for signals: They
start with the &ldquo;<code>DKSignal</code>&rdquo;-identifier and continue with the
interface name and the signal name separated by underscores
(&ldquo;<code>_</code>&rdquo;). Additionally, it is possible to register a custom
notification name for a signal:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">[center registerNotificationName: @&quot;DKNameAquired&quot;
                        asSignal: @&quot;NameAquired&quot;
                     inInterface: @&quot;org.freedesktop.DBus&quot;];
</pre></div>
<p>If this method returns YES, it will be possible to register observers for the
<code>DKNameAquired</code> notification (it might fail if the signal was
already registered under another name).
</p>
<p>Since D-Bus provides a fine-grained matching mechanism for signals,
Objective-C applications can specify in great detail what kind of signal
they want to receive. The full-blown version of the registration method
could be called as follows:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">[center addObserver: myObject
           selector: @selector(didReceiveNotification:)
             signal: @&quot;NameOwnerChanged&quot;
          interface: @&quot;org.freedesktop.DBus&quot;
             sender: theBus
        destination: nil
             filter: @&quot;org.gnustep.TextEditor&quot;
            atIndex: 0];
</pre></div>
<p>If registered as an observer this way, <code>myObject</code> would only
receive a notification if a new application took ownership of the name
<em>org.gnustep.TextEditor</em>. 
</p>
<p>When delivering a notification to the observer, the notification center
will create a <code>NSNotification</code> with a userInfo dictionary that
follows a specific format to allow the receiver to process the
notification:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>member</em></dt>
<dd><p>The name of the signal being emitted.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>interface</em></dt>
<dd><p>The name of the interface the signal belongs to.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>sender</em></dt>
<dd><p>The <em>unique</em> name of the service emitting the signal.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>path</em></dt>
<dd><p>The path to the object of the service that emitted the signal.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>destination</em></dt>
<dd><p>The intended receiver of the signal; might be empty if the signal was
broadcast, which is usually the case.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>arg0, ..., n</em></dt>
<dd><p>If the signal did specify any values to be send alongside the signal,
these values will be present in keys called <em>arg0</em>, <em>arg1</em>,
..., <em>argn</em>. 
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Additionally, calling <code>-object</code> on the notification will return a
proxy to the object that emitted the signal.
</p>
<span id="Recovering-from-Failure"></span><h3 class="section">2.6 Recovering from Failure</h3>
<p>There are two common reasons for failure when communicating with objects on
D-Bus. One is that the service your application is accessing is going away. In
that case, DBusKit will notify you in a way similar to Distributed Objects. This
means that when the service disappears from the bus, the <code>DKPort</code> used will
post a <code>NSPortDidBecomeInvalidNotification</code> to the default notification
center. You can watch for this notification and attempt recovery afterwards. 
</p>
<p>A more critical reason for failure is a malfunction or restart of the D-Bus
daemon. In that case, all affected ports will issue a
<code>NSPortDidBecomeInvalidNotification</code> and additionally the <code>DKDBus</code>
object for the bus will post a <code>DKBusDisconnectedNotification</code> with the
<code>DKDBusBusType</code> identifier at the <code>busType</code> key of the userInfo
dictionary. Afterwards, DBusKit will attempt to recover from the failure in the
background and you cannot use D-Bus services until you receive a
<code>DKBusReconnectedNotification</code>. After receiving the notification, you can
perform recovery as your application requires.
</p>
<p>Please note that usually, such recovery from bus failures will only be
successful for the system bus, for which one connects to a socket
address that is persistent across restarts. For the session bus the socket
address is not persistent, but stored in the <code>DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS</code>
environment variable. Hence your application should assume that the user session
died when it looses connection to the session bus. 
</p>
<span id="Multi_002dThreading-Considerations"></span><h3 class="section">2.7 Multi-Threading Considerations</h3>
<p>By default, DBusKit runs in single-threaded mode. This means that all
interaction with the D-Bus daemon happens on the runloop of the calling thread.
If multiple threads try to send messages D-Bus objects, this model of execution
cannot guarantee that message delivery from and to the bus daemon is
successful. The framework should still be thread-safe in the sense that it will
continue functioning after raising an exception due to timeouts, but the desired
behaviour can only be acheived by putting DBusKit in multi-threaded mode.
</p>
<p>In multi-threaded mode, DBusKit will exchange messages with the D-Bus daemons
via a dedicated worker-thread. To enable this behaviour the
<code>+enableWorkerThread</code> method must be called on <code>DKPort</code>. All
processing will then take place on the worker thread. Developers should
note that after doing so, it is no longer safe to call into DBusKit from
<code>+initialize</code>-methods. The reason for this is that in many recent
Objective-C runtimes, <code>+initialize</code> will obtain a global lock and
subsequent initialisations of classes on the worker thread might cause a
deadlock. Only the GNUstep Objective-C runtime (version 1.4 or later) is not
subject to this limitation. Developers are encouraged to use this feature if
they target recent versions of the GNUstep Objective-C runtime or do not have
any code depending on using D-Bus from <code>+initialize</code>.
