The DBusKit framework provides Objective-C applications with bindings
for the D-Bus inter-process communication system.  It allows Objective-C
applications to transparently access services exposed via D-Bus.

1.1 Build and Install
=====================

Please refer to the 'INSTALL' file for information about dependencies
and instructions about installing the library.

1.2 End-User Services
=====================

Apart from the developer oriented parts, DBusKit ships with two
dynamically loadable bundles that provide interesting services for
desktop systems.  The 'DKUserNotification' bundle is loaded
automatically by the gnustep-base library to integrate with the D-Bus
based desktop notification system.  The 'DBusMenu' bundle is used by the
Gtk theme and allows GNUstep applications to leverage the global menu
bar provided by Ubuntu.

1.3 Mac OS X Support
====================

DBusKit makes use of the typed selectors feature of the Objective-C
runtime.  Since typed selectors are not available in Apple's libobjc,
Mac OS X is not supported by DBusKit.

1.4 Test suite
==============

Execute 'make test=yes' to compile and run the test suite.  This
requires the UnitKit framework from Étoilé and a working D-Bus
installation.

1.5 License
===========

The DBusKit library is covered under the GNU Lesser Public License.
This means you can use it in any program (even non-free programs).  If
you distribute the library along with your program, you must make the
improvements you have made freely available.  You should read the

   The associated tools and examples are covered under the GNU Public
