    <p>

            The EcAlarmSinkSNMP class implements an alarm
            destination which terminates a chain of
            destinations by delivering alarms to an SNMP
            monitoring system rather than forwarding them to
            another EcAlarmDestination object.
              </p>
    <p>
      
          
    </p>
    <p>

            The SNMP functionality of the EcAlarmSinkSNMP is
            essentially to maintain a table of active
            alarms and to send out traps indicating changes of
            state of that table as follows:
              </p>
    <p>
      
          
    </p>
    <p>

            Alarms in the table are each identified by a unique
            numeric identifier, the &apos;notificationID&apos; and traps
            concerning the alarms carry that ID. <br /> For
            each alarm trap sent out, there is a corresponding
            trap sent when the alarm is cleared and removed from
            the table. The clear trap carries the same notification
            identifier as that of the alarm being cleared,
            and the pair (alarm/clear) is known as a correlation.
            <br /> A clear trap is never sent without a
            corresponding alarm trap having first been
            sent. <br /> Each trap carries a sequence number so
            that the SNMP manager is able to detect lost traps.
              </p>
    <p>
      
          
    </p>
    <p>

            For purposes of establishing a correlation between any
            alarms coming in to the system, the managed object,
            event type, specific problem, and probable cause
            values must be the same. When this occurs, any
            matching alarms are given the same notification
            identifier as the first alarm. <br /> When an
            alarm is added to the table, only one trap will to
            notify about it, and no further traps will be sent
            for any correlated alarms arriving unless those alarms
            have new perceived severity values. <br /> If an alarm
            changes its severity, a trap will be sent to clear
            the alarm (removing it from the table) and the alarm
            with new severity will be added to the table and its
            trap sent.
              </p>
    <p>
      
          
    </p>
    <p>

            To allow an SNMP manager to resynchronize with the
            agent, the manager may examine the table of active
            alarms. This may be needed where there is an agent
            error, manager error, or loss of connectivity/traps
            (jumps in the trap sequence number). <br /> The
            entries in the table contain all the same
            information as the alarm traps, apart from the
            trap sequence number.
              </p>
    <p>
      
          
    </p>
    <p>

            After a crash/shutdown and subsequent start-up of the
            agent, the active alarm table is updated with the
            current situation of the system before the manager
            is able to respond to the coldstart (see RFC 1157). When
            the manager receives the agent&apos;s coldstart it may being
            a resynchronization process gathering alarms related to
            the current situation of the system by examining the
            alarm table. <br /> There is a resync flag variable
            which indicates whether a resynchronization process
            is being carried out or not (set to 1 if resync is in
            progress, 0 otherwise). Before sending a trap,
            the variable is checked to know whether the
            resynchronization process is active or
            not. The traps will only be sent to the manager if
            there is no resync in progress, otherwise they will
            be deferred until the resync has completed. <br /> The
            manager may therefore set the resync flag to 1,
            read the contents of the active alarms table, and then
            set the resync flag to zero to resume active operation.
            <br /> As a safety measure to protect against
            manager failure, the resync flag is automatically
            reset to zero if it is left set to 1 for more than
            five minutes.
              </p>
    <p>
      
          
    </p>
    <p>

            In addition to the traps and the alarms table, a table
            of managed objects is also maintained. The system
            guarantees that any managed object referred to
            in a trap is present in the table before the trap is
            sent.
              </p>
    <p>
      
          
    </p>
    <p>

            In order for the manager to know that the agent is
            running, a heartbeat trap is sent periodically.
            The heartbeat contains a notification identifier of
            zero (never used other than for a heartbeat). <br /> A
            poll heartbeat interval variable is provided to allow
            the manager to control the time between heartbeats (in
            minutes) and may be set to a positive integer
            value, or queried.
              </p>
    <p>
      
          
    </p>
    <p>

            The class works by connecting to an SNMP agent using
            the Agent-X protocol, and registering as the &apos;owner&apos; of
            various OIDs in an SNMP MIB so that SNMP requests
            made to the agent for those OIDs are forwarded to the
            EcAlarmSinkSNMP, and so that the
            EcAlarmSinkSNMP can send SNMP &apos;traps&apos; via
            the agent. <br /> To do this, the agent must be
            configured to accept incoming Agent-X
            connections from the host on which the
            EcAlarmSinkSNMP is running, and the alarm
            sink object must be initialized using the
            <a rel="gsdoc" href="#method$EcAlarmSinkSNMP-initWithHost$name$">
              -initWithHost:name:
            </a>

            method to specify the host and port on which the
            agent is listening. <br /> If the EcAlarmSinkSNMP
            object is initialized without a specific host and
            name then it assumes that the agent is running on
            localhost and the standard Agent-X tcp/ip port
            (705).
              </p>
    <p>
      
          
    </p>
    <p>

            To configure a net-snmp agent to work with this software
            you need to:
              </p>
    <p>
      
          Edit /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf to get it to send traps to
          snmptrapd...

<pre>
 rwcommunity     public
 trap2sink       localhost public
 </pre>
      
          and to accept agentx connections via tcp...

<pre>
 agentxsocket    tcp:localhost:705
 master          agentx
 </pre>
      
          Then restart with &apos;/etc/rc.d/init.d/snmpd restart&apos;
          
    </p>
    <p>

            All alarming is done a based on three OIDs which may be
            defined within the user defaults system. The
            EcAlarmSinkSNMP instance is responsible for
            managing those OIDs (and anything below them in
            the OID hierarchy). <br /> By default the OIDs used are
            those specified in the GNUstep MIB (GNUSTEP-MIB.txt),
            but you may override them as specified below:
              </p>
    <p>
      
          
      <dl>
        <dt>AlarmsOID</dt>
        <dd>
          
              All SNMP alarm data is in a fixed structure relative
              to this OID in the MIB. <br /> The table of current
              alarms is at the OID 1 relative to AlarmsOID, so
              you can interrogate the table using;

<pre>snmpwalk -v 1 -c public localhost {AlarmsOID}.1
   </pre>
          
          The resync flag is at OID 2 relative to AlarmsOID and can
          be queried or set using:

<pre>snmpget -v 1 -c public localhost {AlarmsOID}.2.0
   </pre>
          

<pre>snmpset -v 1 -c public localhost {AlarmsOID}.2.0 i 1
   </pre>
          
          The current trap sequence number is at OID 3 relative to
          AlarmsOID and can be queried using:

<pre>snmpget -v 1 -c public localhost {AlarmsOID}.3.0
   </pre>
          
          The heartbeat poll interval is at OID 4 relative to
          AlarmsOID and can be queried or set using:

<pre>snmpget -v 1 -c public localhost {AlarmsOID}.4.0
   </pre>
          

<pre>snmpset -v 1 -c public localhost {AlarmsOID}.4.0 i 5
   </pre>
          
        
        </dd>
        <dt>ObjectsOID</dt>
        <dd>
          
          All SNMP managed object values are in a table relative to
          this OID in the MIB. <br /> SNMP tools are able to
          interrogate the table at this OID to see which
          managed objects are currently registered:

<pre>snmpwalk -v 1 -c public localhost {ObjectsOID}
   </pre>
          
        
        </dd>
        <dt>TrapOID</dt>
        <dd>
          
          The definition of the trap which carries alarms to any
          monitoring system is at this OID.
        
        </dd>
      </dl>
      
      
    </p>
    <p>

        Each of these OID strings must be a representation of an
        OID in the integer dotted format (eg.
        1.3.6.1.4.1.37374.3.0.1).

              Returns the singleton alarm sink instance. <br />
              This instance is the link between the Objective-C

              If the agent is on another host and/or is using a
