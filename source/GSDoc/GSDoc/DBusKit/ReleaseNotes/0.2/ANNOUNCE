1 GNUstep DBusKit Framework 0.2
*******************************

I'm happy to announce a new release of DBusKit, the GNUstep D-Bus
bindings framework.  The framework allows Objective-C applications to
access the D-Bus inter-process communication system.

1.1 Where to get it
===================

You may obtain the code for this release from the GNUstep GitHub
organisation at:

   <https://github.com/gnustep/libs-dbuskit/releases/0.2>

1.2 How to build it
===================

For instructions on how to build DBusKit, please refer to the 'INSTALL'
file in the framework source.

1.3 What is it good for?
========================

The DBusKit framework offers tight integration of D-Bus services into
Objective-C applications.  It handles all low-level details of
communication with D-Bus daemons and the services connected to them and
exposes an interface similar to Distributed Objects to make it easy for
Objective-C programmers to access D-Bus services.

1.4 What's new?
===============

   * The notification center class has been extended to support sending
     signals to other D-Bus services.
   * A bundle implementing user notifications via D-Bus for
     gnustep-base.
   * An implementation of Canonical's global menu protocol for use with
     GNUstep's Gtk theme.

1.5 Deprecation notice
======================

This is the last release of DBusKit that officially supports the GCC
Objective-C compiler and the accompanying runtime library.  Future
releases will require clang and the GNUstep Objective-C runtime.

1.6 Where do I send bug reports?
================================

Bug reports are highly appreciated.  You can log bug reports on the
GNUstep project page (http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=gnustep) or
send them to <bug-gnustep@gnu.org>.
