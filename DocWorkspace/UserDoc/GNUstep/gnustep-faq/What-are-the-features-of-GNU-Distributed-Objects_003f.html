<p>GNU Distributed Objects has many of the features of other distributed
objects implementations, but, since it is free software, it can be
ported to platforms for which other distributed objects implementations
are not available.
</p>
<p>[ NOTE: The GNU distributed object facilities have the same ease-of-use
as Apple&rsquo;s; be warned, however, that they are not compatible with each
other.  They have different class hierarchies, different instance
variables, different method names, different implementation strategies
and different network message formats.  You cannot communicate with a
Apple NSConnection using a GNU NSConnection.  
</p>
<p>Here are some differences between GNU distributed objects and Apple&rsquo;s
distributed objects: Apple NSDistantObject asks it&rsquo;s remote
target for the method encoding types and caches the results; GNU
NSDistantObject gets the types directly from the local GNU &quot;typed selector&quot;
mechanism if the information is known locally and only queries the remote
target or caching encoding types when using a method that is not known to
the local process.  The NSProxy for the remote root object always has name
and, once set, you cannot change the root object of a NSConnection; the GNU
Proxy for the remote root object has a target address value just like
all other Proxy&rsquo;s, and you can change the root object as many times as
you like. ].
