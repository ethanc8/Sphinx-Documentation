<p>GNU contracted with Aladdin Enterprises to add some key features to GNU
Ghostscript so it could be used as a DPS server. This work has mostly
been done, although Aladdin did not completely finish the work that they
were contracted for.  (Because the work took longer than specified and
was not completed, Aladdin agreed to waive approximately $10,000 in
promised fees for the work that was actually done and delivered.)  DGS
works fairly well with a single context.  Alpha channel and compositing
doesn&rsquo;t work.
</p>
<p>Currently, further development on DGS has been abandoned.  The library
based approach using libart, cairo, etc works much better.
